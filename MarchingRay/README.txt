In this version of Marching Squares, I used the same basic algorithm used in the video, but coded it in JavaScript. 


I also added some extra features.
Press S: Scrolls the screen to make the "map" scroll to the left. 
Press C: To change some of the dots values randomly (changing the overall map)
Press D: Toggle the dots values between 1 and 0
Press UP: Scale the grid larger (regenerates a new map, does not "zoom in" on current map)
Press Down: Scale the grid smaller (regenerates a new map, does not "zoom in" on current map)
